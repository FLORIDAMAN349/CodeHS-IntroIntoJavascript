1. Pair-programming is basically where two programmers work together to write programs. 
2. The role of the driver is to write the code using their keyboard and mouse.
3. The role of the navigator is to find bugs/erros in the code the driver writes and fixes them accordingly.
4. One benefit of pair-programming is the fact that there is a really good chance that there will no bugs in the code.
5. Some challenges that I expect to arise during pair-programming is the fact that the two programmers may not get along well. And another challenge is that sometimes it is really hard to work together. Lastly, it is 15% slower to code as a pair rather than coding solo.
