//NOTE: THIS IS WHAT I DID FOR MY FINAL PROJECT. PLEASE EDIT OR MAKE YOUR OWN ACCORDINGLY!
//ANOTHER NOTE: This is 12.1.1 (planning and design) assignment, the other ones are named: 12.1.2 Pseudocode, 12.1.3 Write the Code!, and 12.1.4: Present your Project.
I will provide a google slides link but you may need to edit it/make your own.

Title of my program: Chess AI in CodeHS
Every chess piece can move throught the board (unless its an illegal move)
The entire program will function like a normal chess board and game.
Something like the bots in chess.com
the most important things I will be using are timers (maybe a litteral timer for the time per player or something like that), functions, and variables (obviously)
Possible upgrades to the chess board: Custom Colors, Custom Textures.
You can disable AI on both sides if you want or keep one side on (so you can play against someone)
Pieces are from the wiki (for black and white) (may not have custom textures because of this)

FINAL FEATURES:
 - AI vs AI or player vs player with 'blackAI' and 'whiteAI' variables
 - Variable screen height and width rendering
 - Custom number of columns and rows for board rendering
 - Customizable weights for pieces
 - Customizable colors
