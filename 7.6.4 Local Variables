/* All you have to do in this exercise is write a good comment that explains

 */
// Local variables are variables that are nested inside of a function. The scope of the variable defines whether it is a constant variable or a local variable
// For example:
 var CONSTANT_VAR = 0; 
 function start(){
     var hello = 0;
}
// In the function above the variable hello is the local variable and on the very top is a constant (not local variable) named "CONSTANT_VAR".
